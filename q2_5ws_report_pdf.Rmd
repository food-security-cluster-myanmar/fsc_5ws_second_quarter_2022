## Summary of achievements

Beneficiaries of humanitarian action formed `r round(filter(fsc, humanitarian_or_development == "Humanitarian") %>% {sum(.$new_beneficiaries, na.rm = TRUE)} / sum(fsc$new_beneficiaries, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 2)`% of the `r sum(fsc$new_beneficiaries) %>% format(big.mark = ",")` beneficiaries in the first quarter of 2022. The remainder were reached through development interventions.

To recall, the Food Security Cluster's strategic objectives for 2022 are:

-   SO1: IDPs have equitable access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food (either in-kind or through food assistance)
-   SO2: Vulnerable persons (excl. IDPs) have equitable access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food (either in-kind or through food assistance)
-   SO3: Restore, protect and improve livelihoods and resilience

Overall, `r hd_list %>% filter(hd == "Humanitarian") %>% pull(pc)`% of the food security cluster's beneficiaries were from humanitarian activities.

<br>

```{r table-so-humanitarian}
fsc %>%  
  filter(humanitarian_or_development == "Humanitarian" | activity_red == "food distribution") %>% 
  group_by(so, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = quarter, 
              values_from = beneficiaries, 
              values_fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(total = q1 + q2) %>% 
  rename_all(.funs = list(str_to_title)) %>% 
  rename(SO = So) %>%  
  mutate(total_pc = Total / sum(Total)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(total_pc), ~ round(.x * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  select(SO, Q1, Q2, 
         Total, `total%` = total_pc) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row") %>%  
  kable(caption = "2022 Q1 & Q2 humanitarian beneficiaries", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ","),

```

<br>

A total of `r hd_list %>% filter(hd == "Development") %>% pull(pc)`% beneficiaries were from development activities and actors.

<br>

```{r table-so-development}

fsc %>%  
  filter(humanitarian_or_development == "Development" & activity_red != "food distribution") %>% 
  group_by(so, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = quarter, 
              values_from = beneficiaries,

```

Activities with significant increases in beneficiaries reached compared to Q1 include food/cash for work/assets, multi-purpose cash transfers and vocational training. New persons reached by farmer field school and farmer training dipped, likely due to the seasonality of the intervention. Encouragingly, the number of new persons reached by food distributions in Q2 was `r activity_list %>% filter(activity_red == "food distribution" & quarter == "q2") %>% pull(pc)`% as opposed to `r activity_list %>% filter(activity_red == "food distribution" & quarter == "q1") %>% pull(pc)`% in Q1, showing increasing investment in more durable solutions. Myanmar will likely face a prolonged food security crisis.

<br>

```{r table-activity}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(quarter, activity_red) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>%  
  pivot_wider(values_from = beneficiaries, names_from = quarter, values_fill = 0) %>%

                                   "HEB and fortified rice for acute emergencies"), 
                               activity_red,
                               str_to_sentence(activity_red))) %>% 
  rename(Q1 = q1, Q2 = q2, 
         Activity = activity_red) %>%
  mutate(Total = Q1 + Q2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Beneficiaries by activity, Q1 & Q2 2022", format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped")


```

<br>

```{r ben-type-list}
ben_type_list <- fsc %>%
  filter(str_detect(activity, "food distribution")) %>% 
  group_by(beneficiary_type) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>% 
  mutate(pc = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2))
```

Food distributions overwhelmingly target moderately-food-insecure persons in host and local communities, this group forms `r ben_type_list %>% filter(beneficiary_type == "Host/local Community") %>% pull(pc)`% of all beneficiaries of food distributions.

<br>

```{r food-distributions-fs-status}

fsc %>% 
  filter(str_detect(activity, "food distribution")) %>% 
  group_by(activity, beneficiary_type) %>% 
  mutate(activity = str_extract(activity, "\\, \\w+$"), 
         activity = str_to_title(str_replace(activity, ", ", ""))) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>%

  kable(caption = "Food distributions by type food insecurity status and beneficiary type", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped")

```

<br>

55% of beneficiaries were reached by activities where nutrition had been mainstreamed.

<br>

```{r table-nutrition-mainstreaming}
fsc %>% 
  mutate(so = str_to_upper(so)) %>% 
  mutate(was_nutrition_mainstreamed_in_activity = ifelse(is.na(was_nutrition_mainstreamed_in_activity),

## 1. Geographies

### 1.1 States

```{r state-list}
state_list <- fsc %>% 
  sum_ben2(state, quarter) %>% 
  group_by(quarter) %>% 
  mutate(pc = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2))

```

Though new beneficiaries reached remained biased towards Yangon and Rakhine in Q2, figures were less skewed than they were in Q1. Overall `r state_list %>% filter(quarter == "q2" & state %in% c("Yangon", "Rakhine")) %>% summarise_at("pc", sum) %>% pull(pc)`% of beneficiaries in Q2 came from Yangon or Rakhine, whereas it was `r state_list %>% filter(quarter == "q1" & state %in% c("Yangon", "Rakhine")) %>% summarise_at("pc", sum) %>% pull(pc)`% in Q1. Kayah saw the largest quarter-to-quarter increase in number of beneficiaries.

<br>

```{r facet-state-quarter, fig.height = 6.5}
q1_admin3 <- fsc %>% 
  filter(quarter == "q1") %>% 
  distinct(admin3_pcode) %>% 
  as.list()


fsc %>% 
  group_by(state, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>% 
  mutate(quarter = recode(quarter, 
                          "q1" = "Quarter_1", 
                          "q2" = "Quarter_2")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beneficiaries, y = fct_reorder(state, beneficiaries))) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = state)) + 
  facet_row(vars(quarter), scales = "free_x", space = "free") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = number_format(scale = 1 / 1000, suffix = "K")) + 
  guides(fill = "none") +
  geom_text(aes(label = comma(beneficiaries)), hjust = "inward", size = 3.5) + 
  labs(x = "Number of beneficiaries reached", 
       y = "", 
       title = "Beneficiaries reached by quarter") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121"))
  

```

<br>

A total of `r distinct(fsc, admin3_pcode) %>% nrow()` townships have been reached across `r distinct(fsc, admin1_pcode) %>% nrow()` states/regions.

<br><br>

### 1.2 Townships

```{r top-townships-pc, include=FALSE}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(state, township) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(pc = beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pc)) %>% 
  filter(beneficiaries > 150000) %>% 
  {sum(.$pc)}
```

The top 7 townships, each from Yangon or Rakhine contained 68% of all beneficiaries.

<br>

```{r table-top-townships}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(state, township, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(values_from = beneficiaries, names_from = quarter, 
              values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(total = q1 + q2, 
         pc_total = total / sum(total)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(matches("pc")), ~ round(.x * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pc_total)) %>% 
  filter(pc_total >= 1) %>% 
  select(state, township, Q1 = q1, Q2 = q2, 
         Total = total, `%total` = pc_total) %>%
  kable(caption = "Top townships by beneficiaries reached", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped") %>% 
  footnote("Only showing townships with >1% of total beneficiaries", 
           general_title = "")
```

<br>

Comparing the food security cluster's footprint in the first quarter, with that from the second quarter, new activity can be noted in Mandalay, Magway, Kayah and Kayin.

```{r maps-ben-quarter, fig.height=9}

# ggsave("./maps_q1_q2.png", dpi = 300, height = 9, width = 8, units = "in")
  
```

<br>

26 new townships were added in the second quarter of 2022, including 5 from Ayeyarwady and 3 each from Mandalay, Magway and Tanintharyi.

<br><br>

### 1.3 Locations

A location refers to either a village, ward, IDP site or industrial zone.

The vast amount of project locations have only one food security activity.

<br>

```{r}
fsc %>% 
  filter(!is.na(location)) %>% 
  group_by(location, township, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries), 
            activities = n_distinct(activity), 
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(activities = ifelse(activities >= 3, ">=3", activities), 
         activities = fct_relevel(activities, 
                                  c("1", "2", ">=3")),
         activities = recode(activities, 
                             "1" = "1_activity", 
                             "2" = "2_activities", 
                             ">=3" = ">=3_activities"),) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beneficiaries)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, trans = "log10") + 
  facet_wrap(~ activities) + 
  labs(y = "Number of locations", 
       x = "Beneficiary frequencies by location", 
       title = "Beneficiary frequencies by location, faceted by number of activities") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
          strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121"))
```

<br>

With some exceptions, the vast majority of project locations have only one partner present.

<br>

```{r histogram-parnters-location}
fsc %>% 
  filter(!is.na(location)) %>% 
  group_by(location, township, location_type) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries), 
            partners = n_distinct(org_code), 
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  filter(location_type != "Industrial zone") %>% 
 # mutate(partners = ifelse(partners >= 3, ">=3", partners), 
 #        partners = fct_relevel(partners, 
 #                                 c("1", "2", ">=3")),
 #        partners = recode(partners, 
 #                            "1" = "1_activity",

 #                            ">=3" = ">=3_partners"),) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = partners, fill = location_type)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  stat_bin(binwidth = 1, geom = "text", size = 3, 
           aes(label = ..count..), 
           position = position_stack(vjust = 0.9)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#F1C40F", "#1ABC9C", "#EC7063")) +
  facet_wrap(~ location_type) + 
  labs(y = "Number of locations", 
       x = "Number of partners by location", 
       title = "Beneficiary frequencies by location, faceted by number of partners") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
          strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121"))
```

<br>

224 villages have more than one partner present. The table below breaks down the beneficiaries from these locations by activity and state.

<br>

```{r table-more-than-one-partner}
fsc %>%  
  filter(!is.na(location)) %>% 
  group_by(location, township, state, location_type, activity_red) %>%

<br>

The food security cluster's partners can mostly be found in Yangon, Rakhine and Kachin.

## 2. Activities

### 2.1 Progress by activity

The first dotted red line shows the end of Q1 and the second shows the end of Q2. The thick line in grey shows the progress in 2021 for the same activity. It is observed that food distributions in 2022 greatly outpaced those in 2021. The same is also true for cash/work for food/assets and crop, vegetable and seed kits. 

<br>

```{r progress-facet-lineplot}

act_line_2021 <- fsc_2021 %>% 
  filter(unique_beneficiaries == "Yes") %>%
  mutate(date = date + years(1)) %>% 
  group_by(activity_red) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>%

  mutate(activity_red = str_replace_all(activity_red, "provision of ", "")) %>% 
  filter(activity_red %out% c("fishery kits", 
                              "community infrastructure and equipment"))

fsc %>% 
  group_by(date, activity_red) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  # rbind(fsc_2021 %>% 
  #         # filter(unique_beneficiaries == "Yes") %>%

                              "community infrastructure and equipment")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = cum_ben, colour = activity_red)) +

  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5, angle = 60, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5), 
        strip.text = element_text(size = 6, face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121")) +

# ggsave("activity_facet_line.png", dpi = 300, height = 5, width = 8, units = "in")  

```

<br>

Newly implemented in Q2 of 2022 was the provision of HEB and fortified rice, largely in Chin state. Food distributions continued to be the largest activity, followed by the provision of crop, vegetable and seed kits.

<br><br>

### 2.2 Agricultural and livelihoods activities

The percentage of beneficiaries reached by agriculture and livelihoods activities (crops, vegetable and seed kits; FFS and farmer training; IGA and small grants; livestock kits) slightly in Q2 2022, compared to Q1.

<br>

```{r table-agricultural-activity}
fsc %>% 
  mutate(agricultural_activity = ifelse(activity_red %in% c("crop, vegetable and seed kits", 
                                                            "FFS and farmer training", 
                                                            "IGA and small grants", 
                                                            "livestock kits"), "yes", "no"), 
         quarter = recode(quarter, 
                          "q1" = "One", 
                          "q2" = "Two")) %>% 
  group_by(agricultural_activity, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  group_by(quarter) %>% 
  mutate(`%beneficiaries` = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2), 
         agricultural_activity = fct_rev(agricultural_activity)) %>% 
  arrange(quarter, agricultural_activity) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beneficiaries, y = fct_rev(quarter), fill = agricultural_activity)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = .9)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = `%beneficiaries`), 
            position = position_dodge(width = .9), 
            hjust = "inward") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#D35400", "#76D7C4")) +
  labs(x = "Number of beneficiary frequencies", 
       y = "Quarter", 
       fill = "agricultural\nactivity",
       title = "Beneficiaries reached by agriculture and livelihoods activities") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, 
                     breaks = c(100000, 
                                500000, 1000000, 
                                2000000, 3000000))

```

<br>

The vast majority of beneficiaries of agricultural and livelihoods activities are recipients of farmer training and crop, vegetable and seed kits. It is possible that not all of Q2 was available for farmer training.

<br>

```{r barplot-facet-ag-activities}
fsc %>% 
  filter(activity_red %in% c("crop, vegetable and seed kits", 
                                                            "FFS and farmer training", 
                                                            "IGA and small grants", 
                                                            "livestock kits")) %>% 
  group_by(activity_red, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  group_by(quarter) %>% 
  mutate(`%beneficiaries` = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2), 
         quarter = recode(quarter, 
                          "q1" = "Quarter_1", 
                          "q2" = "Quarter_2"), 
         ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = beneficiaries, y = activity_red, fill = activity_red)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = .9)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = comma(beneficiaries)), 
            position = position_dodge(width = .9), 
            hjust = "inward") +
  facet_wrap(~ quarter) +
  labs(x = "Number of beneficiary frequencies", 
       y = "", 
       fill = "agricultural\nactivity",
       title = "Beneficiaries reached by agriculture and livelihoods activities") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = number_format(scale = 1 / 1000, suffix = "K")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121"))

```

<br><br>

### 2.3 Delivery modalities

Only community infrastructure and equipment, HEB and fortified rice and kitchen garden kits were delivered entirely through in-kind modalities.

<br>

```{r}
fsc %>% 
  filter(!is.na(delivery_modality)) %>% 
  mutate(delivery_modality = case_when(str_detect(delivery_modality, "Hybrid") ~ "Hybrid", 
                                       str_detect(delivery_modality, "Service") ~ "Service delivery", 
                                       TRUE ~ delivery_modality)) %>% 
  group_by(activity_red, delivery_modality) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), 
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = delivery_modality, values_from = beneficiaries) %>% 
  adorn_percentages("row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  left_join(fsc %>%
          filter(!is.na(delivery_modality)) %>%
          mutate(delivery_modality = case_when(str_detect(delivery_modality, "Hybrid") ~ "Hybrid", 
                                       str_detect(delivery_modality, "Service") ~ "Service delivery", 
                                       TRUE ~ delivery_modality)) %>%
          group_by(activity_red) %>%
          summarise(Beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), 
                    .groups = "drop"), 
          by = "activity_red") %>%
  arrange(desc(Beneficiaries)) %>%
  mutate(activity_red = ifelse(activity_red %in% 
                                 c("FFS and farmer training",
                                   "IGA and small grants", 
                                   "HEB and fortified rice for acute emergencies"), 
                               activity_red,
                               str_to_sentence(activity_red))) %>% 
  rename(Activity = activity_red) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(`In-kind`, `Service delivery`, `CBT/CVA`, `Hybrid`), ~recode(., "-" = NA_character_)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Percentage of beneficiaries reached by activity and delivery modality", format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped")
```

<br>

There are also clear differences between the different beneficiary types and the delivery modalities employed with them. Beneficiaries from host/local communities largely received in-kind distributions whilst those from camps and IDP sites mostly received cash-based interventions.

<br>

```{r facet-ben-type, fig.height=6}

fsc %>%  
   mutate(delivery_modality = case_when(str_detect(delivery_modality, "Hybrid") ~ "Hybrid", 
                                       str_detect(delivery_modality, "Service") ~ "Service delivery", 
                                       TRUE ~ delivery_modality)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(delivery_modality) & !is.na(location_type)) %>% 
  sum_ben2(delivery_modality, beneficiary_type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = delivery_modality, y = beneficiaries, fill = delivery_modality)) +
  geom_col() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + 
  facet_wrap(~beneficiary_type, scales = "free") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust = .7, hjust = .5),
        legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121")) +
  labs(x = "Delivery modality", y = "Beneficiaries",
       title = "Delivery modalities by beneficiary type")
  

```

<br>

Areas with more IDPs, such as Sagaing, Rakhine and Kachin, reach most of their beneficiaries through cash-based programming.

<br>

```{r delivery-modalities-stacked-bar}
state_totals <- fsc %>% 
  filter(!is.na(delivery_modality)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>% 
  mutate(pc = 1, 
         state = fct_reorder(state, total))

fsc %>%  
  filter(!is.na(delivery_modality)) %>%  
   mutate(delivery_modality = case_when(str_detect(delivery_modality, "Hybrid") ~ "Hybrid", 
                                       str_detect(delivery_modality, "Service") ~ "Service delivery", 
                                       TRUE ~ delivery_modality)) %>%
  group_by(state, delivery_modality) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  mutate(pc = beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries),
         state = fct_reorder(state, beneficiaries)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pc, y = fct_rev(state), fill = delivery_modality)) + 
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, by = .2)) + 
  geom_text(aes(y = state, x = pc + 0.125, label = comma(total, accuracy = 1), fill = NULL), 
            data = state_totals, hjust = "inward", size = 2.5) +
  labs(x = "% of total", y = "", fill = "", 
       title = "Percentage of beneficiaries reached by delivery modalities", 
       subtitle = "State beneficiary totals at the end of each bar")

```

<br><br><br>

## 3. Cash-based programming

### 3.1 USD per household

Compared to Q1, beneficiaries in Q2 are much less likely to have received cash transfers of less than USD 10 per household. The most common transfer values were between USD 60 and 70, an increase from the previous quarter.

<br>

```{r usd-hhd-bin-barplot, fig.height=5}

fsc %>%
  filter(!is.na(usd_per_hhd) & !is.na(new_beneficiaries)) %>% 
  filter(delivery_modality %in% c("CBT/CVA", "Hybrid (In-kind & CBT/CVA)")) %>%
  group_by(usd_hhd_bin, quarter) %>% 
  summarise(households = sum(households)) %>% 
  group_by(quarter) %>% 
  mutate(`%_of_hhd` = round(households / sum(households) * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(quarter = recode(quarter,
                          "q1" = "Quarter_1", 
                          "q2" = "Quarter_2")) %>%  
  mutate(usd_hhd_bin = fct_relevel(usd_hhd_bin, c("<$10", ">=$10_<$20", ">=$20_<$30", ">=$30_<$40", ">=$40_<$50",">=$50_<$60", 
                                                  ">=$60_<$70", ">=$70_<$80", ">=$80_<$90",">=$90_<$100",">=$100"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = usd_hhd_bin, y = households, fill = usd_hhd_bin)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = `%_of_hhd`), vjust = -0.4, size = 3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ quarter) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "mako", direction = -1) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, breaks = seq(0, 80000, by = 10000)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 0.8, vjust = 0.9), 
        strip.text = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#212121")) +
  labs(x = "USD value of cash transfer per household per month",
       y = "Number of households",
       title = "Number of households by value of cash transfer per household (2022/Q1)",
       subtitle = "Figures at the top of each bar show percentage of households\nOnly households reached through the cash, hybrid or voucher modalities are included")
```

<br><br>

### 3.3 USD per person

The boxplots above shows the range of cash transfer values (all values are per person, to facilitate comparability) by activity. The average for reach activity is marked by the thick line in the middle of each box. The leftmost and rightmost side of each box indicate the 25th and 75th percentile of transfer values, respectively. The length of each box is a gauge for how much variation there is in the transfer values of each activity.

<br>

```{r boxplot-activity-usd-per-person}

fsc %>% filter(!is.na(total_value_usd) & activity_red %out% c("FFS and farmer training", "vocational training")) %>%
  mutate(activity_red = fct_relevel(activity_red, 
                                    c("food distribution",
                                      "food_cash for work_assets", 
                                      "multi-purpose cash transfer", 
                                      "livestock kits",
                                      "crop, vegetable and seed kits",
                                      "IGA and small grants"
                                      ))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = activity_red, x = usd_per_person, colour = activity_red)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = .1, aes(size = beneficiaries)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .8, outlier.alpha = .2) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", breaks = c(0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000), 
                     labels = dollar_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "USD per person", y = "", 
       title = "Boxplots of USD transfer values per person in 2022 (Q1 & Q2)", 
       subtitle = "Thick line in each box is the mean;\n Points are individual distributions, sizes indicate number of beneficiaries")

 
```

<br>

Each of the bubbles represents an individual distribution, with their position along the x-axis showing the USD per person value of the distribution and the size of each bubble indicating the number of beneficiaries reached.

Food distributions tended to have the tightest range of values.

  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 1, alpha = 1))) + 
  facet_wrap(~ quarter)


```

<br>

Cash transfer values tended to be higher in Q2 as compared to Q1 largely due to increases in the per-household package of multi-purpose cash transfers.

Kachin, Rakhine and Shan notably have several extreme outliers much higher than the average for that state. Kayin, however, has a very large number of beneficiaries who received less the USD 1/person. Distributions in Chin and Ayeyarwady had very consistent values as they were all implemented by the same implementing partner.

The table below compares the different bins for cash transfer values of food distributions with the minimum expenditure basket for food established by the Cash Working Group. They have established a floor of MMK 190,555 (or USD 114.55).

Overall, `r round((filter(fsc, usd_per_person >= (114.55 / 5) & activity_red == "food distribution") %>% {sum(.$new_beneficiaries)}) / (filter(fsc, !is.na(usd_per_person) & activity_red == "food distribution") %>% {sum(.$new_beneficiaries)}) * 100, digits = 2)`% of food distribution beneficiaries have received at least 100% of the MEB and `r round((filter(fsc, usd_per_person >= (114.55 / 5 / 2) & activity_red == "food distribution") %>% {sum(.$new_beneficiaries)}) / (filter(fsc, !is.na(usd_per_person) & activity_red == "food distribution") %>% {sum(.$new_beneficiaries)}) * 100, digits = 2)`% have received at least 50% of the MEB (USD 11.45 per person).

### 4.2 Evidence of food insecurity status

Of the food security activities reported, very few provided details about the food insecurity status of beneficiaries. This makes it difficult ot determine whether interventions are truly reaching those most in need.

In general, the food insecurity status of the beneficiaries of multi-purpose cash transfers were much better documented than the statuses of those who received food distributions.

<br>

```{r table-food-insecurity-status}
fsc %>% 
  filter(str_detect(activity, "moderate|severe")) %>% 
  mutate(has_evidence = ifelse(is.na(evidence), "no", "yes"), 
         food_insecurity_status = ifelse(is.na(food_insecurity_status), "NA", food_insecurity_status), 
         food_insecurity_status = fct_relevel(food_insecurity_status, "NA", after = Inf)) %>% 
  group_by(activity, food_insecurity_status) %>%
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(activity = str_replace_all(activity, "\\(in kind/voucher/cash\\)", ""), 
         activity = str_replace_all(activity, "\\(MPC\\)", ""), 
         activity = str_replace_all(activity, " , ", ", ")) %>% 
  group_by(activity) %>% 
  mutate(`%of_group` = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Mismatch between food insecurity status and activity (Q1 & Q2 2022)", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ","), 
        format = "html", 
        table.attr = "style='width:80%;'") %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped")
```

<br>

Evidence of beneficiaries' food insecurity status provided to the cluster include:

<br>

```{r table-fs-evidence}
fsc %>% 
  mutate(evidence = case_when(evidence %in% c("0.97", 
                                              "98% of HH have Acceptable FCS", 
                                              "99% of households have acceptable FCS") ~ 
                                "Acceptable FCS",

                                "Post-distribution monitoring", 
                              str_detect(evidence, "consumption|intake") ~ "Acceptable FCS", 
                              evidence %in% c("Provision/Support Report", "MDR") ~ 
                                "Regular reporting",
                              is.na(evidence) ~ "No evidence", 
                              TRUE ~ evidence), 
         evidence = fct_relevel(evidence, "No evidence", after = Inf)) %>% 
  group_by(evidence) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>% 
  mutate(`%_beneficiaries` = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2)) %>%

        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

<br>

The general lack of evidence of evidence of beneficiaries' food insecurity status makes it difficult to justify to affected communities and donors that the Food Security Cluster is reaching the most in need. This highlights the need to promote a shared understanding of the response through the development of a common prioritisation tool for food security partners.

<br><br><br>

### 4.3 Beneficiary disaggregation

In this section, a test is applied to determine if the disaggregated numbers of beneficiaries reach have been copied and pasted -- a somewhat common practice that sullies the quality of the data. To do this, the proportions of each disaggregation group by partner have been compared to how close they were to the mean for the entire group. To explain: if partner A reported that 40% of beneficiaries in an activity were adult females, this percentage was then compared to the average percentage of adult females for all other activities reported by that partner. This measure whether or not the same proportions were copied and pasted throughout the 5W form.

It is extremely unlikely that these percentages would be similar across activities as implementing partners worked in an average of `r round(fsc %>% group_by(org_code) %>% summarise(locations = n_distinct(location)) %>% {mean(.$locations)}, digits = 2)` locations.

In the plot below, the closer a value is to 0% on the x-axis, the more likely it is that it was copied and pasted. It is estimated that 73% of beneficiary disaggregation values were copied and pasted.

<br>

```{r}
fsc_disagg <- fsc %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(child_male:elderly_female), names_to = "disagg", values_to = "ben_sub") %>%

  filter(ben_sub != 0) %>% 
  mutate(ben_prop = ben_sub / beneficiaries, 
         ben_prop_compare = abs(census_prop - ben_prop) / census_prop,
         same_as_census = ifelse(ben_prop_compare < 0.05, "backfilled", "real"))

fsc_disagg_values <- fsc_disagg %>%

  summarise(ben_sub = sum(ben_sub)) %>% 
  adorn_percentages("col") %>%  
  mutate(ben_sub = round(ben_sub * 100, digits = 2))
```

```{r disagg-histogram}
fsc_disagg %>% 
  filter(new_beneficiaries > 0) %>% 
  mutate(pc_disagg = ben_sub / beneficiaries) %>% 
  group_by(org_code, disagg) %>% 
  mutate(mean = mean(pc_disagg), 
            sd = sd(pc_disagg, na.rm = TRUE),
            ben_sub = sum(ben_sub, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(cat = ifelse(sd >= .05, "real", "fake"), 
         cat = ifelse(is.na(cat), "real", cat)) %>% 
  # group_by(cat) %>% 
  # summarise_at("new_beneficiaries", sum) %>% 
  # mutate(pc  = new_beneficiaries / sum(new_beneficiaries))
  filter(sd <= 1) %>%

  geom_histogram(binwidth = .02) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = .05, lty = 2, colour = "red") +

  labs(x = "Percentage difference from group mean", 
       title = "Histogram of standard deviations across beneficiary disaggregations", 
       subtitle = "The lower the standard deviation, the more likely the value is to be copy/pasted.\nCut-off is the red line.") 

```

<br>

Once the copy-pasted values are removed, this is the breakdown of beneficiaries by disaggregation group:

<br>

```{r barplot-disagg}
fsc_disagg %>% 
  filter(new_beneficiaries > 0) %>% 
  mutate(pc_disagg = ben_sub / beneficiaries) %>%

  mutate(cat = ifelse(sd >= .05, "real", "fake"), 
         cat = ifelse(is.na(cat), "real", cat)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(cat == "real") %>% 
  group_by(disagg) %>% 
  summarise(ben_sub = sum(ben_sub)) %>% 
  mutate(pc = ben_sub / sum(ben_sub),

## 5. Partners

### 5.1 Implementing partner

There are `r fsc %>% filter(quarter == "q2") %>% distinct(org_code) %>% nrow()` partners that were involved in direct implementation that have reported achievements in second quarter of 2022, in comparison with `r fsc %>% filter(quarter == "q1") %>% distinct(org_code) %>% nrow()`in the first quarter. These implementing partners corresponded to a total of `r fsc %>%  distinct(report_org_code) %>% nrow()` reporting organisations. The largest reporting organisation, 2690, had 24 implementing partners.

<br>

```{r table-reporting-orgs}

  kable(caption = "Reporting organisations with the most implementing partners", 
        format = "html",

  kable_classic_2("striped") %>% 
  footnote(general = "All others had 1 or 2 implementing partners", 
           general_title = "")
```

The interactive plot below shows the number of beneficiaries and townships reached by implementing partner.

`r fsc %>% group_by(org_code) %>% summarise(townships = n_distinct(admin3_pcode)) %>% filter(townships > 5) %>% nrow()` partners (21% of the total) have a presence in more than 5 townships. `r fsc %>% group_by(org_code) %>% summarise(townships = n_distinct(admin3_pcode)) %>% filter(townships > 10) %>% nrow()` partners are present in more than 10 townships.

The table below lists the top 15 partners by number of beneficiaries reached in 2022.

<br>

```{r}

### 5.3 Donors

The table below summarises the reach and scope (in terms of geographic extent and number of organisations supported) of donors who support at least two reporting organisations. FCDO and LIFT support the most expansive programmes.

<br>

```{r}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(donor) %>% 
  summarise(report_orgs = n_distinct(report_org_code), 
            implementing_orgs = n_distinct(org_code), 
            states = n_distinct(admin1_pcode), 
            townships = n_distinct(admin3_pcode)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(donor) & report_orgs > 1) %>% 
  arrange(desc(report_orgs)) %>%
  head(15) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Organisations supported and geographic reach by donor", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped", full_width = FALSE) %>% 
  footnote(general = "Only showing donors supporting more than one reporting partner.", 
           general_title = "")
 
```

<br>

Sagaing, Shan (East) and Ayeyarwady have the fewest number of donors present.

<br>

```{r table-donor-states}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(donors = n_distinct(donor), 
            implementing_partners = n_distinct(org_code)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(donors)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Number of donors by state", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped", full_width = FALSE) 

```

<br>

However, as shown by the table below, even though the majority of partners reported their donors, the omission of data from three key partners has resulted in the vast majority of reported beneficiaries not being associated with any donor.

<br>

```{r table-donors-beneficiaries}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(donor) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries)) %>% 
  mutate(donor = ifelse(is.na(donor), "No donor specified", donor), 
         donor = ifelse(beneficiaries < 1000, "Other donors", donor)) %>% 
  group_by(donor) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  mutate(`%_beneficiaries` = round(beneficiaries / sum(beneficiaries) * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`%_beneficiaries`)) %>% 
  head(15) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Top donors by beneficiaries reached", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped", full_width = FALSE)
 
```

<br>

Below is a table of beneficiaries who are missing donors, grouped by state.

<br>

```{r missing-donor}
fsc %>% 
  filter(is.na(donor)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries), 
            partners = n_distinct(org_code)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(beneficiaries)) %>% 
  filter(beneficiaries > 0) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Reported beneficiaries with missing donor data", 
        format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

## 6. Comparison with targets

### 6.2 Reached vs target by township

The specifics of each township can be reviewed with the interactive plot below. Each point is a township, with the size indicating the number of beneficiaries. The x-axis indicates the target population by township and the y-axis shows the number of beneficiaries reached in Q1 and Q2 2022.

The red line down the middle represents reaching 100% of the target. Townships above this line have reached more beneficiaries than their target and townships below the line have not met their target yet. The further away a township is from the red line, the further above or below its target it is. Mouse over each of the townships to see more details.

The 13 townships along the extreme left side of the plot have beneficiaries but do not have targets (their targets have just been coded as 1 so that they show up on the plot). 209 townships with targets have not been reached.

### 6.3 Interactive reference table

There was an overallocation of resources in these relatively few areas in 2021 and this has continued in the first quarter of 2022. In the interactive table below, is a list of townships sorted by the gap between the targeted population and beneficiaries reached in 2022. Any of the columns can be sort; the search bars above each column can also assist in filtering.

<br>

```{r}
fsc %>% 
  group_by(admin3_pcode_old) %>% 
  summarise(beneficiaries = sum(new_beneficiaries),
            partners = n_distinct(org_code)) %>%
